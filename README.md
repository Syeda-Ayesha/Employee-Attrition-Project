## 1)Employee Attrition EDA:
## Data
The dataset we use is publicly available and can be access from [here](https://excelbianalytics.com/wp/downloads-21-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-till-5-million-records-hr-analytics-for-attrition/).The dataset has (1000000R X 37C) that contains numeric and categorical data types describing each employeeâ€™s background and characteristics; and labelled (supervised learning) with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else. Machine Learning models can help to understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition.

## 3)Employee Attrition feature selection:
*Initial model building using evalML without feature selection
###Feature Selection
####Feature importance using random forest classifier (Selected top 21 features):
*comment: After selecting important features we applied some algorithms and most of them attain 50% accuracy.

####Feature selection using SelectKBest (Selected top 15 features):
*comment: Important features were selected using SelectKBest and we applied some algorithms and most of them attain 50% accuracy.

## 4)Employee Attrition Model-1:
comment: After performing feature selection most of the models encountered with the lower accuracy of 50% , so we decided to keep all the features for model building.

### Model Building
*We have trained and tested various machine learning classification models.

## 5)Employee Attrition Model-2:
*As we were getting lower accuracy from the model-1, so we have developed this model-2 by creating a new column "attrition_within_a_year" using "YearsAtCompany" column, to see whether an employee get attritioned with in a year or not. We made this "attrition_within_a_year" feature as our dependent variable and dropped the "attrition" column from our dataset. Initially it was in imbalanced form, so for handling that we used a oversampling technique(SMOTE).

### Model Building
*We have trained and tested various machine learning classification models.
